# UFOs - Module 11

Working with JavaScript to complete a research project of UFO sightings.

Dana, working with scientists and CEOs, has embarked on a lifelong goal of researching the existence of UFO and alien lifeform. She embarks on this journey by utilizing her resources to find, compile, review and analyze these data. To complete the process and provide information to others, she creates a data repository website https://github.com/GodIsLove4U/UFOs/blob/master/static/js/app.js. 

She continues to research this topic, as new information continues to come in. This project involved the use of JavaScript and VS Code, along with review of other sites such as W3Schools, JS Bin, StackOverflow and Mozilla Developer Network.
